# ROS_study

---
## This repository has tutorial codes for ros programming and my project codes.


### 1. odom_practice
this package is practice that how to calculate odometry.
calculate velocities of wheels and yaw. and visualize with rviz.
 1. run launch file.
 2. run rviz
 3. run teleop prog.
 4. check rviz and gazebo.
 
 you will see results below here

### 2. fourth_robot_navigation
This package is not my original source. But I progressed code review wit my study members.
If this package raises any issue, I'll delete it immediately.

So I understood amcl roughly, especially about particle filters.
Particles contain probability of robot's loclization, and particles are computed with Monte Carlo Algorithm.
An this img shows Particles of robot.
